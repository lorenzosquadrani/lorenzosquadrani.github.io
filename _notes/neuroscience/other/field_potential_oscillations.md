### What is the field potential

### Oscillations

The oscillations occurs in a broad spectrum of frequencies.
The following classification has been made:

- Delta frequency (0.4-4 Hz)
- Theta frequency (4-8 Hz)
- Alpha frequency (8-12 Hz)
- Beta frequency (12 - 30 Hz)
- Gamma frequency (30-100 Hz)

Each frequency is associated with different behavioral states and cognitive functions.
