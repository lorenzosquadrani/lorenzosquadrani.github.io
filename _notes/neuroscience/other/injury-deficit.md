### Broca's area


Pierre Paul Broca, in the 1860s, observed that damage to the posterior portion of the left frontal lobe, specifically the posterior inferior frontal gyrus, now known as Broca's area, resulted in a specific language deficit. His most famous patient, Leborgne (nicknamed "Tan"), could understand spoken language but was unable to produce more than a single syllable, despite otherwise normal cognitive abilities. Broca found similar deficits in other patients with lesions in the same region.

Broca concluded that this area was crucial for the production of articulated language. The deficit, later termed "Broca's aphasia," is characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech with relatively preserved comprehension, although understanding complex sentences can be impaired. Broca's systematic clinical and autopsy studies established that language production is typically lateralized to the left hemisphere and localized to this specific frontal region.


### Wernicke's area

Carl Wernicke (1874): Wernicke observed that damage to the posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) resulted in fluent but nonsensical speech and poor comprehension. This complemented Broca's findings by showing that different brain regions control different aspects of language.

### The medial temporal lobe

The case of H.M. is historically famous.
Due to uncontrollable seizures, he had large portions of the medial temporal lobe removed in surgery. 
The portions included all the hippocampal formation, the amygdala, and another area which I do not know.
H.M. had perfectly intact working memory (seconds to minutes), but as soon as he was distracted, he lost the memories.
He could not form new long-term memories after the surgery.
The long-term memories he had before were intact.

Similar but milder effects were observed in R.B., which had only a destruction of pyrmadial cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
