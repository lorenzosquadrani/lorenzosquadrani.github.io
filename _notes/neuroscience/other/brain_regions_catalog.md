### Dentate Gyrus (DG)
The DG is a hippocampal brain region.
It receives input primarily from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and sends its output to CA3 (Amaral et al., 2007).

It shows the largest gamma power
among the hippocampal regions (Buzs√°ki and Vanderwolf, 1983).
The DG has been proposed to act as a gamma generator. However, unlike the CA3 generator, it is not independent of EC input (Csicsvari et al., 2003). Since the EC is already
gamma frequency modulated, it is unclear to what extent the DG generates its own gamma rhythm or whether it merely
relays EC gamma. At least at theta frequencies, the EC strongly drives the DG (Mizuseki et al., 2009)


It is essential for pattern separation (Yassa and Stark, 2011) and has  
IN types and circuitry of the DG have been extensively studied, and parvalbumin-positive (PV+
) INs in particular, have revealed extensive recurrent connections (both electrical and chemical) with other PV+ INs (Espinoza et al., 2018).

In the DG the GCs are the principal cell type and outnumber basket cells by a factor of 1:100 in the suprapyramidal and
1:180 in the infrapyramidal blade (Amaral et al., 2007).
