- Prominin-1 (CD133). A trans-membrane protein selectively found in the apical plasma membrane of neuroepithelial cells.
- afadin (AF6). A proteina associated with adherens junctions. Its knock-out perturbs the polarized organization of neuroepithelial cells. 
- Rho GTPase family members. They are low-molecular-weight guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that function as binary molecular switches by cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state.
