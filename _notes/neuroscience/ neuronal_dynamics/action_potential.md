title: "Action Potential"

The action potential is perhaps the most characteristic phenomenon exhibited by neurons.
It is at the basis of neuronal _exicitability_, the very reason they are called _excitable_ cells.



### Membrane Capacitance

It is a measure of the lipid bilayer's ability to store charge, with values for different neuron types typically ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 μF/cm².

### Reverse potential of ions

- Sodium $Na$: 
- Potassium $K$:
- Calcium $Ca$:

### Ionic currents commonly used in neuron models

#### Sodium current $I_{Na}$

#### Delayed rectifier potassium current $I_{Kdr}$

#### Leakage current $I_L$

This represents the hyperpolarizing current driving the membrane potential to its resting value.
It is not ion-specific.

#### A-type potassium current $I_A$

#### Muscarinic-sensitive potassium current $I_M$

#### Persistent sodium current $I_{NaP}$

Definition:

$
 I_{\text{NaP}} = g_{\text{NaP}} p_\infty (V) (V - V_{\text{Na}})
$

$
p_\infty (V) = \frac{1}{1 +  e^{-\frac{V - \theta_{\text{NaP}}}{\sigma_{\text{NaP}}}}}
