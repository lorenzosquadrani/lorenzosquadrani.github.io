I look at two papers [1, 2], one from 2017 and one from 2025.
The first is as an experimental paper, the second a modeling one.

### Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields (Bittner et al., 2017)


Their closing sentence is: "Thus, BTSP may provide a more straightforward physiological basis for many types of learning than plasticity that explicitly conforms to Hebbâ€™s postulate.
