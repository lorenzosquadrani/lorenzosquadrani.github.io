Below the text, taken from [here](http://www.monologuearchive.com/s/shakespeare_030.html).

<div align="center">
JAQUES: All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like a snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

List of vocabs for which I had to use the dictionary:
- [Mewling](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/mewling)
- [Satchel](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/satchel)
- [Creeping](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/creeping)
- [Sighing](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/Sighing)
- [Woeful](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/woeful)
- [Oaths](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/oaths)
- [Quarrel](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/quarrel)
- [Treble](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/treble)

Here's the passages that I struggled to understand:
- 'with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow' - It could mean that the lover wrote a ballad for the woman he loves, in which he describes the beauty of her eyebrow. Or maybe woeful could be associated with eyebrow, so the ballad makes the woman cry.
- 'bearded like the pard' - pard could be short for leopard or ghepard, or just a similar animal.
- 'Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth.' - It could mean that he acts in order to gain reputation, a reputation which is illusory and ephemeral like a bubble, even when his own life is in danger. He gives more importance to a bubble than to his life.
- 'with good capon lined' 
- 'Full of wise saws and modern instances'
- 'Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;'

Here's the worlds which I pronounced wrongly:
- [mere](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/mere) 
- [world](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/world) 
- [part](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/part?q=parts) 
- In general, remember that the g at the end of -ing words is not pronounced!
- [then](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/then)
- [sighing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/sigh?q=sighing)
- [bearded](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/bearded)


### Shylocks

Text taken from [here](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/merchant/merchant.3.1.html).

<div align='center'>
SHYLOCK: To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
will better the instruction.
