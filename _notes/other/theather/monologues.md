Below the text, taken from [here](http://www.monologuearchive.com/s/shakespeare_030.html).

<div align="center">
JAQUES: All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like a snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

List of vocabs for which I had to use the dictionary:
- [Mewling](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/mewling)
- [Satchel](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/satchel)
- [Creeping](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/creeping)
- [Sighing](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/Sighing)
- [Woeful](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/woeful)
- [Oaths](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/oaths)
- [Quarrel](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/quarrel)
- [Treble](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/treble)

Here's the passages that I struggled to understand:
- 'with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow' - It could mean that the lover wrote a ballad for the woman he loves, in which he describes the beauty of her eyebrow. Or maybe woeful could be associated with eyebrow, so the ballad makes the woman cry.
- 'bearded like the pard' - pard could be short for leopard or ghepard, or just a similar animal.
- 'Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth.' - It could mean that he acts in order to gain reputation, a reputation which is illusory and ephemeral like a bubble, even when his own life is in danger. He gives more importance to a bubble than to his life.
- 'with good capon lined' 
- 'Full of wise saws and modern instances'
- 'Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;'

Here's the worlds which I pronounced wrongly:
- [mere](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/mere) 
- [world](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/world) 
- [part](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/part?q=parts) 
- In general, remember that the g at the end of -ing words is not pronounced!
- [then](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/then)
- [sighing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/sigh?q=sighing)
- [bearded](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/bearded)
