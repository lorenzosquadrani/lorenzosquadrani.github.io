Today (2/01/2025) I bought a full desktop setup: PC tower, monitor, keyboard, mouse. 
I spent 330€ for the PC, 150€ for the monitor, 20€ for keyboard and mouse.
I really wanted to have everything ready by the day, so I did not do much research or even much thinking.
Now, quite stupidly, I want to go deeper and understand how many bad choices I made.

Let us start from the CPU.
It is an Intel Core i5-8500.
We can check the information about this model on wikipedia.
It is an 8th generation processor, released in Q2 2018. 
It has 6 cores, 6 threads, a base clock rate of 3.00 GHz (4.10GHz turbo).

It is important to keep in mind that, expecially in the recent years, comparing CPUs is becoming more and more difficult. 
Even CPUs from the same brand are difficult to compare.
The typical quantities like the clock rate are no more than "slightly informative".
A CPU with lower clock rate could outperform the higher clock rate one.
The efficiency of a CPU depends on a lot of structural factors, and it is hard to measure because it depends on a lot of external factors.

Today , an 8th generation CPU is quite old.
Refurbished, I can find it for as little as 35€ euros on Ebay or 50€ on a Amazon.
Considered that there is no dedicated GPU, the CPU should be the most expensive component 
of my tower. 
Thus, it seems like 330€ was a bit a scam.
However, I cannot find any offer for a PC desktop with a newer CPU costing less than 300€.
Weird. 
Is assemblying your PC Desktop so much convenient?
As I try to assemble my dummy PC Desktop on pcpartpicke.com, I realize there are so many components
which are not that cheaper than a CPU: motherboard, RAM, SSD, case, power supply. 
So maybe it was not such a scam.

So I asked myself the question: if the price difference between a 12th generation and an 8th generation CPU is 80€, why cannot I find a PC Desktop which has a 12th generation CPU and costs 400€?
I asked the questiont to the guys of Kenovo. 
The PC Desktop I bought is not an "assembled" one. 
The CPU is integrated with the motherboard, so you cannot change it (unless you change the motherboard I guess). 
Anyway it is not practice to change the CPU of a PC desktop.
Thus, if you want to have a 12th generation CPU, the whole PC desktop must be newer.
Also, they say their main supplier of PC Desktop are companies, which do the leising. 
Leiseing lasts 2 years usually, so they only sell products at least 2 years old.

So here the things that I am not happy about the processor:
- it is of 8th generation, which I thought was fairly recent but it is 7 years ago; I am not sure how much significant this is though.
  It feels like it is quite relevant. I read somewhere that "this CPU is too old to compete with new ones".
-  

Here the things that I am happy about the CPU:
- The CPU is an Intel, thus based on x86 architecture, and the majority of software for Microsoft Windows is written for x86.
The CPU could have been based on two architectures: x86 and Arm.
Truth be told, it would be extremely rare to find an Arm-architecture CPU on a PC (unless it is an Apple Mac older produced after 2020).
Anyway, architecture is important with respect to the software you need to run. 
Indeed, the source code of a software is typically written for a specific architecture. 
The software could run on another architecture but with performance drop.
- it has 6 cores, which is more than the bare minimum.


Espansione 8gb RAM circa 50€
Espansione 256gb SSD circa 25€
Espansione da 4 core a 6 core 76€
Processione migliore 76€
Scheda grafica migliore 50-200€
Velocità processore da 3.50 a 3.60 76€
Fascia estremamente alta: 64gb RAM invece di 8-16, 1000gb di ssd, 6 core, velocità processore 1.90?
CPU: n cores (2,4,6,8), clock freq, turbo technology, 
Ram: capacity, speed, timings
