# Oscillations in Dynamical Systems

What are the minimum elements of a dynamical system which exhibits oscillations?

A bifurcation is a qualitative change of phase portrait of the dynamical system.
A qualitative change is typycally a change in the properties of the stationary points. 
For example a stable node becomes an unstable node; a new attractor, limit cycle, appears.

A bifurcation is not necessary for oscillations.
However, bifurcations are usually at the basis of neuron excitability.
