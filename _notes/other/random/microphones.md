Three main types of mic:
- Lavalier mic - the one you attach to your clothes, so that the person can move
- Directional/Shotgun mic - very sensitive to a specific direction, for isolation
- Condenser mic - short range, but richer frequency spectrum

Is it possible to have a good mic integrated with a camera? Surprisingly, it does not seem so.
The problem is the performance of a mic are bound to the size.

### Condenser mic

Basically you take a RØDE PodMic and that's it.
It is VERY comfortable that you can connect it both with USB-C and XLR.
