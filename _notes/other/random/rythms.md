### What is a ryhtm?

Well not as trivial as one could expect. 
To define rythm, I mean.

From a youtuber: "Rythm is a sound or event that repeats regularly over time".
At the hearth of rythm lies the beat, which just the sound we referred to in the definition.
A set of beats appropriately repeated are called a pulse.

So a pulse might be the usual: 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, ...
Then a rythm could be: 

1    ---     2     ---          3          ---  4
clap --- clap clap --- clap clap clap clap --- clap

Sequences of notes and pauses disregarding the pitch, this could be another definition of rythm.
To properly write rythm, you need to use a line of the pentagram.

The time signature is represented as two number stacked on top of each other.
The top number is the number of beats in a bar/measure. 
The time signature is 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, or so on.
Given that our piece of music is in 4/4, we can have a lot of rythms.


### Waltz

The Waltz is a 3/4 rythm, meaning that there are 3 beats.
They are all equally spaced, so it is very simple.
The first bit is marked as 'stronger', givn the classic 'um-pa-pa' feeling of the Waltz.
