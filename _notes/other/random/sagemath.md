I arrived at the software SageMath by searching for open-source alternatives to Mathematica.

SageMath is built on many Python libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sympy).

I watched the video introduction from William Stein, but it felt a bit to historical and outdated.
The mission statement of Sage is to create viable free open source alternative to Mathematica and similar. 


Sage stands for Software for Arithmetic Geometry Experimentation.

### Installation

I follow the installation guide for Linux.
I was honestly a bit pissed off that the latest update was available for Arch Linux and not for Ubuntu. 
What the fuck. 
Isn't Ubuntu the most popular linux distribution?
Moreover, Linux Mint did not have any official distribution package.

So I used conda/mamba.

Also, I read that installing it from source would optimize performances. 
This is because the installation will be more "taylored" to my specific system.
However, the software would then make use of all shared libraries on my system, and any update could break it. 
Moreover, upgrading the software would be not automatic. 
I guess too much.
