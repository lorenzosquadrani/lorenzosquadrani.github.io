There are three types of bike's valves that you may encounter: 
- Schrader (or American) valve
- Presta (or French) valve
- Woods (or Dunlop or English) valve

You can distinguish them using the image below:

Usually, bike pumps have two sides, one for Schrader and one for Presta valves.
The Presta valve should work also with Woods valve.
