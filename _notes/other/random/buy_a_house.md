Here's some points yet to be organized:

- visit the house both during the day and during the night: is it reached enough by the sun during the day? is there too much noise during the night?
- evaluate the position of the house: distance from work, schools and services like parks, shops, doctors, public transports; the safety of the district.


### Tax relief
First, you want to check the official website of your government for tax reliefs.
Most countries will offer reliefs for young people buying the first house.
For example, in Italy everything is described [here](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/guida-acquisto-abitazione).
