### Who is studying blackheads?

### What are blackheads?

### What causes blackheads?

### How close should you be to the mirror?

It's really important to mention, that these pores are very often mistaken for blackheads while they are actually just normal organs. If you don't see these spots without standing with your face close to the mirror, they are just normal working pores. It's also normally that they turn black, that's just the oxidation. Remember, nobody will ever watch your skin that close!

### In practice

In practice, just try doing something and see if it works. 
If it doesn't work, try something else.
If it doesn't work again, just let it be.

Remember to try one thing at a time. 
There is no need to rush, and you need to understand what is actully useful.

For god's sake, start by trying the cheapest stuff.

Now I have already make a mistake LoL. 
I bought a BHA 2% from Paula's Choice, for 13â‚¬, 30ml.
Let us see if it works and how long it lasts.

### Yet to be organized
Almost everybody agrees with this two steps:
1. Oil cleansing
2. Salicylic acid or glycolic acid (exfoliant acid)

Almost everybody will suggest you to use salicylic acid to reduce blackheads.
Everybody agrees that blackheads cannot be removed completely.

Salylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA).
Another acid that they suggest is glycolic acid, which is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA).

The acid acts as an exfoliant, removing dead skin cells that can clog pores.

Then there is oil cleansing. 
The idea is that oil dissolves oil.
So they made this product, which is an oil that you apply on your face and then you wash it off with water.
It is supposed to not leave your skin oily.

Somebody says that if you sweat a lot, you might tend to have more blackheads.

Vanicream facial soap (from Amazon). 2% zinc pyrithione zinc. Anti-fungal.
Oil cleanser worked for me. Kose softymo deep, I rub it on dry skin for two to three minutes, focusing on the problem areas like my nose. Then rinse off with water. 

A peeling once or twice a week with AHA acid can help though to get rid of any dark spots or visible pores. I recommend the Schaebens strawberry mask for that.
