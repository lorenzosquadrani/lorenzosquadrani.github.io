### The pathways of anxiety

So let us go to the Nature website, and search for the keyword 'anxiety' in the journal 'Nature Neuroscience'.
The first result it reference 1, let us see what it tells us.

#### Experimental protocol
They gathered 27 human subjects (with no history of psychiatric care/medication for anxiety or depression).
They assessed their anxiety levels with a self-report (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory).
They asked them to complete an image classification task, while also exposed to neutral and threat-related distractors at different frequencies.
They use fMRI to observe the lateral prefrontal cortex (lateral PFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), during the task.

#### Observations

In both the ACC and the lateral PFC, they defined multiple ROIs.
They compare the activity of the ROIs considering to the conditions:
- start trial or non-start trials
- neutral distractor or threat-distractor
- frequent-threat distractor or infrequent threat distractor.


In a specific region of ACC (rostral ACC), the activity was significantly higher when an infrequent-threat-distractor was presented with respect to a neutral or frequent-threat distractor.

The general activity level of rostral ACC had a significant negative correaltion with the level of anxiety.

During start trials (when expectancy was being established), in the lateral PFC, the activity difference between frequent and infrequent threat-distractors show a significant negative correlation with the level of anxiety.


#### Conclusions

This result suggests that heightened anxiety may be associated with reduced recruitment of the lateral PFC circuitry required to augment attentional control as expectancy of threat-related distractors is established.

Our results suggest distinct roles for rostral ACC and lateral PFC in governing the processing of task-irrelevant, threat-related stimuli, and indicate reduced recruitment of this circuitry in anxiety.

The paper is not written very clearly, but the results are interesting.
In particular, I find it impressive that significant correlations between brain activity and the results fo the self-report on anxiety could actually be established.
