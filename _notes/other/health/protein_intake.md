The International Sociaty of Sports Nutritions stands:

- It seems like it make sense to take proteins soon before or after the muscle-stimulating exercise. Current evidence favors the post-exercise period as a time when rapid hyperaminoacidemia promotes a marked rise in the rate of MPS. 
- The protein intake should be in the range of 1.4–2.0 g protein/kg body weight/day. It is unsure whether higher doses have some benefits, but it seems like not. A review paper from 2018 suggests that protein intakes at amounts greater than ~1.6 g/kg/day do not further contribute RET-induced gains in FFM.
- The protein doses should ideally be evenly distributed, every 3–4 h, across the day, with 20-40g per "session".
- There are also some tips for specific proteins but I ignore them for now.


I also tried the app Macrofactor suggested and co-owned by Jeff Nippard on Youtube.
