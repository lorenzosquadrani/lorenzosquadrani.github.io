Collecting information from multiple sources you quickly realize that everything a matter of opinion when it comes to how to train in the gym.
Despite the amount of scientific research, "facts" are quite rare. 
Mainly the only two facts are: for your muscle to grow, you need to put them under stress and then let them recover.

The second rule that I like is already more an arbitrary rule that a fact, but I appreciate its pragmatism.
The rule is: to train all the muscles of your upper body you need to do four exercise: a vertical push, an horizontal push, a vertical pull, an horizontal pull. 
The same applies for your lower body.
What do push and pull, horizontal and vertical mean very clear from some examples: bench press is an horizontal push, overhead press is a vertical push, pull ups are a vertical pull, row is an horizontal pull.

In the end I just decided to go for the Stronglift 5x5 program, mainly for comfort.

The notions I heard and I trust the most are the ones from Pietro.
He said that by convention an excercise is usally made of 25 repetitions subdivided in $n$ series.
For example, typical schemes are 5x5, 4x6, 3x8, ecc.
The number is just convention, what counts is the weight that you lift.
He said that squats is a must exercise.
He said that increasing the weight every time (provided that you could finish the exercise) is the basic principle.
Pietro says that strength is developed only with multijoint exercises.
He said he never trained triceps or biceps on its own but they are still big.

He had a special training day of only arms, in case it had to train two days in a row (weekend). 
This is pull-ups + dips + inclined bench press.
He had two workouts A and B, which alternated with a break of two days between training sessions.
Workout A is squats + bench press + something for the back.
Workout B is squats + something + something.

He cited stronglifts as a good source.

Among the reasons why 5x5 is a good system:
- get a lot of practice and adaptation for central nervous system, quite bullshit
- it tends to be associated with composite weight lifting exercise, I mean ok
- if you get a little bit better at barbel squat, the return are so much better than if get a little bit better at leg press or leg extension
- if you do 5x5 you do not do tens of exercises, you do a handful of them; you are likely gonna pick the big compounds one, you get really practical during the sets, so the last one you really give it all
- practice is so imporant, on those movements like squats
- lower reps remove some fatigue, and let you perform each rep a bit better.

No 18 excersices every time.
2-4 exercise per week per muscle in your plan
Chest: 
Flat Press (dumbel or barbel)
Incline press 
Fly movement

Back:
Pull-ups
Rows
Deadlifts
Flexion rows

Biceps:
