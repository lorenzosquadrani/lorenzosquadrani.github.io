The nervous system, including the brain, is made out of cells, which are divided in two categories: neurons and glia.



All neurons have the same complement of genes, but they can express a restricted set and thus produce only certain molecules.
For this reason, there are about 100 distrinct types of neurons.


### What does a neuron look like?

Neurons and glia derive from the same stem cells, thus they have many properties in common.

As any cell, their boundaries are defined by the cell membrane (impermeable to most water-soluble substances).
Within the boundaries they are filled with cytoplasm.
The cytoplasm is composed of an aqueous phase (called cytosol), some free proteins (not many, mostly enzymes), and organelles.
Organelles are functional complexes of protein, which may or not be enclosed by a membrane (membranous organelles).

Non-membranous organelles include:
- the tail of the NMDA receptor, formed by more than 100 scaffold proteins
- ribosomes, on which mRNA molecules are translated
- proteasomes, large multienzyme organlles that degrade proteins

Membranous organelles include:
- mitochondria - that generate ATP by cellular energy is transferred or spent
- peroxisome - that prevent accumlation of hydrogen peroxide (strong oxidizing agent)
- vacuolar apparatus - a set of tubules, vesiscles and cisternae, including the endoplasmatic reticulum, the Golgi comples, secretory and transport vesiscles, endosomes, lysosomes.


### Birth of brain cells



How does a neuron born? 
Is 'born' the right word? I mean, could each cell in an organism be considered a living being? Let us not divagate lol.

It was observed that some cells can duplicate themselves; this process is called self-renewal.
It was observed that come cells can evolve into two or more type of cells, according to some external conditions; this process is called multipotent differentiation.
All cells that exhibit both self-renewal and multipotency are called *stem cells*.

A group of stem cells, called *neural stem cells*, give rise to all the neurons in the mammalian central nervous system.
They are also called *Neuroepithelial cells*.

At a certain point during the development of the embryo, a single layer of weird cells is formed.
We call this layer *neuroepithelium*, and the cells *neuroepithelial cells*.
At the beginning the neuroepithelium looks like a plate, and it is called *neural plate*.
Then the cells multiply and the neural plate changes shape until it becomes more a *neural tube*.
Then they keep multiplying, and the neuroepithelium transforms into a tissue with numerous cell layers.
Then neuroepithelial cells give rise to *radial glial cells*.

In contrast to early neuroepithelial cells, most radial glial cells are not multipotent: they are restricted to
the generation of a single cell type, either astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or neurons.
But how do they know if a radial glial cell that turns into, let us say, a neuron, was forced to do that from the start, or something happened afterwards? BOH.


Neurons develop their complex structure in five stages, as observed in rat hippocampal cultures:

- Stage 1: Neurons attach to a surface and form a lamellipodium.
- Stage 2: Several short neurites emerge, extending and retracting without significant growth.
- Stage 3: One neurite rapidly elongates to become the axon.
- Stage 4: The other neurites slowly grow into dendrites.
- Stage 5: The axon and dendrites mature, dendritic spines form, and the neuron establishes synaptic connections and electrical activity.
