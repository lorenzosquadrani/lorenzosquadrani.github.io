title: "Astrocytes and Synaptic Plasticity"

In 2009 the research group of Alfonso Araque publishes a review paper titled "Tripartite synapses: astrocytes process and control synaptic information".
The term "tripartite synapse" was proposed in 1999.

The concept of tripartire synapse developed from the acknowldgement of some facts: 
- astrocytes detect neural activity via neuron-released neurotransmitters and, in turn, modulate synaptic transmission via release of 'gliotransmitters'.
- Astrocytes are ideally positioned to detect and modulate synaptic activity because they extend processes that are in apposition with pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements of synapses


Astrocyte Ca2+ signal has a fundamental role in neuron-astrocyte communication as the cellular signal triggered by the neuronal activity and responsible for transmitter release from astrocytes and the consequent neuromodulation.

They even refer to an "astrocytic revolution in current neuroscience".
Everything started in the early 1990s with the first fluorescence imaging experiments of intracellular calcium concentrations in living astrocytes.
The data revelead the excitability of astrocytes, that were till then considered non-excitable cells.


### Astrocytic compartments

Astrocytes exhibit intricate spongiform morphology, dense process ramifications of irregular shape with frequent small broadenings.
These enlargements are referred to as astrocytic compartments.
They have a diameter of 1-2 micrometers (Figures in Panatier, 2011).

Spontaneous Ca2+ responses were observed in compartments with an amplitude of dF/F = 92.2% ± 9.3% and a rise time of 277.7 ± 38.8 ms.

Single pulse stimulation of neuronal presynaptic elements evoked local Ca2+ events in an astrocytic process.
The blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels, to prevent nerve-impulse propagation, completely blocked glial Ca2+ responses.
The absence of fluorescent changes outside of the boundaries of the compartment suggests that the Ca2+ event is compartmentalized.

### Astrocytes and Short-term plasticity

Despite this ideal position, the detection and modulation mechanisms in astrocytes are deemed too slow to be involved in local modulation of rapid, basal synaptic transmission.

However, Ca2+ signaling has been generally studied globally in the whole astrocyte, where the slow timescale of Ca2+ changes precludes any spatial and temporal match with
fast and localized synaptic transmission.
Moreover, trains of sustained stimulation of afferents were necessary to induce this type of glial Ca2+ activity.
Panatier et all, in 2011, showed that single action potentials are detected in functional compratments along the astrocytic processes, via activation of glutamate receptor mGluR5. 
They also showed that astrocytes increase synaptic transmission via activation of presynaptic adenosine receptors A2A.

These results indicate that astrocytes detect small levels of neurotransmitter released locally, simultaneously with its detection by the postsynaptic neuron.
